# Overview
To demonstrate the C++ langauge, I wrote a simple hangman problem that reads a random word from a file and allows the user to guess it in the normal hangman style.

This was an exercise of exploring a new language for me, as I've never utilized such a low-level programming language before where the programmer is responsible for handling many more of the finer details.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

This was built in Apple's XCode environment, which is ideal for C++ on Mac. No external libraries were used, though several native packages were utilized including unordered_set, fstream, and sstream.
