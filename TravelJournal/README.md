# Overview

TravelJournal is a simple, interactive app built in React Native. It allows you to save your memories with a small note to remind you of notable experiences and events! It is a basic program with lots of future potential.

Mobile app development is a field I've always wanted to try but never been sure where to start with. This simple program was the perfect opportunity to bite the bullet and get a leg up on the initial learning curve.

# Development Environment

The project was developed in Visual Studio Code, using built-in iOS emulators to run and test the code.

React Native powers this app using Expo as the bootstrap and plugin service, as it were. Expo was critical in making the image picking experience seamless.

# Future Work

* Saving list of notes to local storage to allow information to persist after closing the app
* Building the app and launching it to the store (what does that process actually entail)
* Trying to build it without Expo
* Ensuring it works on Android and iOS (currently only tested on iOS)
